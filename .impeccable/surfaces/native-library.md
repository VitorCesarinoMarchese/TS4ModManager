# Native mod library

Mode: Operate.

User-approved direction: a mod-platform library closer to Deadlock Mod Manager and CurseForge. Photo cards are the default; a compact list is available. Keep the existing Fastframe desktop app and every management workflow.

First viewport: persistent navigation rail for all, installed and stored mods; compact game-folder header; library title and actual counts; search, state filters and card/list switch; large preview cards with names, authors when known, ownership and installed state; selected-mod inspector on wide windows. Import folder, Import ZIP and Restore from trash sit in the library toolbar. Settings opens a full page from the header. The bottom is a compact local-library status with notices, errors and disclosed Activity history. Narrow windows collapse the rail and replace cards with details after selection.

Visual world: charcoal surfaces, warm off-white text, muted gold accent inspired by the Deadlock app, restrained borders, 12-point card corners, clear standard sans typography. Light mode translates the same hierarchy onto warm neutral surfaces. No fabricated discovery feed, downloads, profile or update counters.

Signature interaction: selecting a photo card highlights its border and opens a persistent inspector; switching installed/stored filters changes the collection without mutating files. Card/list switching preserves search and selected identity. Selection is immediate, with standard egui hover and keyboard-visible focus treatment. Right-clicking a card or list row selects the clicked identity before opening the same menu as inspector More actions. Enable/Disable remains direct in the inspector or narrow detail view. No custom selection animation is added.

Settings extension: retain the existing warm-gold light and charcoal dark identity. Settings replaces the central library and inspector, with Back to library and Save settings above the scroll region. Wide library filters also return to browsing. The form includes built-in and saved-theme selection, custom-theme creation and naming, six hex fields with color pickers, reset, theme JSON copy/import for editing, game folders, source lookup and settings transfer. Saving validates, applies and persists the custom draft. Built-in choices in Settings need saving; the header light/dark switch saves immediately. Custom themes stay in local settings; compatible settings transfer omits them and uses separate theme JSON for colors.

Quality bar: https://deadlockmods.app/ and https://www.curseforge.com/sims4. Match their library density, photo prominence and navigation hierarchy, while keeping only real local management capabilities.

Verification: virtualized cards and list, real pointer input, filters intersect filename search, clicked-identity context menus, narrow navigation, photos/fallback, full-page Settings, persistent saving, custom-theme editing and transfer compatibility. `native/verify_navigation.py` produces nine library, Settings and custom-theme captures with unchanged synthetic inputs. Independent review returned ship. Native tests, catalog input-preservation checks and the packaged 18-operation workflow passed alongside full project validation. Native egui code is outside the HTML/CSS design detector.
