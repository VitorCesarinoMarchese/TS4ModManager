# Product

<!-- impeccable:product-schema 1 -->

## Platform

Linux native desktop, built with Fastframe and egui. This is not an iOS or Android interface. The desktop UI in `native/` uses the Rust domain library in `core/`.

## Users

The Sims 4 players managing their local mods and custom content.

## Product purpose

Browse a local mod library, inspect photos and files, and manage installed state without losing original files or metadata.

## Capabilities and constraints

Preserve all existing native management features: folder/ZIP import, reviewed enable/disable, external migration, rename, explicit source attachment/removal, trash/restore, settings transfer, search and photo previews. No mod downloads or updates. Source candidates must come from real provider data and require user confirmation. Never permanently delete user files or remove unmanaged files.

## Brand commitments

The user requested a replacement design closer to Deadlock Mod Manager and CurseForge, with photo cards as the default library and a list switch. Preserve the Sims 4 Mod Manager name. Build directly in the app rather than generating a mockup.

## Evidence on hand

The current native implementation is in native/src. The migration completion report records filesystem behavior and validation. Existing user mod previews are content, not bundled artwork. Missing photos must show No Preview; never invent mod metadata or source candidates.

## Product principles

- Keep the app local-first.
- Keep management actions explicit and recoverable.
- Prioritize fast library browsing and photo recognition.
- Preserve complete file and source inspection.
