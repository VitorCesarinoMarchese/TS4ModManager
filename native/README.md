# Native mod manager

The Fastframe/egui UI uses the existing Rust core to detect game folders, scan mods, search names and filenames, and manage local mods. Photo cards are the default library view; the card/list switch offers compact rows. Cards, catalog rows and file lists render only visible rows. A replaceable reader handles scans. A separate FIFO worker retains approved management operations and reports their queued, running, and finished states.

Import folder is the primary action in the library toolbar, beside Import ZIP and Restore from trash. Settings in the header opens a full page. Select a managed mod for direct Enable/Disable controls in the inspector or narrow detail view. More actions contains Enable/Disable, rename, source lookup/attachment/removal and trash. Right-click a photo card or list row to select that mod and open the same menu. External mods offer Manage external mod with a file review before migration. The compact bottom status shows local-library information, notices and errors; Activity expands operation history when present.

Requires Rust 1.98 or later and native Linux graphics support. Fastframe is pinned to `bb79dbddef01e660f9cfc37ccd9dff1c299a8d47`. `Cargo.lock` pins the resolved dependencies, including egui/eframe 0.36.2. The native app uses published egui/winit rather than the optional Fastframe forks.

Run from the project root:

```bash
cargo run --manifest-path native/Cargo.toml --locked
```

Open a custom game folder, the directory containing `Mods`:

```bash
cargo run --manifest-path native/Cargo.toml --locked -- \
  --root '/path/to/The Sims 4'
```

The window follows the desktop theme, with a light/dark switch that immediately applies and saves the chosen mode while retaining custom colors. Select Change folder to choose another detected game folder or enter a path and select Open. Search works over display names and filenames. The library shows large photo cards by default, and details show a larger preview. All, Installed and Stored navigation filters intersect the current name/filename search. Filter counts come from the actual catalog. Changing a filter does not mutate files. Switching between cards and list rows preserves search and selected identity. Saved local PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF images and HTTP(S) URLs load in the background without a Referer header. Missing, broken, and unsupported previews show No Preview. Preview loading writes no preview files. Source attachment and removal require explicit confirmation. Select a card or row to inspect files and saved source metadata. Wide windows have a navigation rail and persistent inspector. Below 1040 logical points, state tabs replace the rail; selected details replace the catalog and offer Back to mods. Copy copies the full file list and confirms with Copied. Files show their basename above the containing folder; truncated names have full-path tooltips.

The default managed root is `~/.local/share/sims4-mod-manager`. Scanning does not create it. Override it with `--managed-root PATH`. Use `--help` for all options. The scanner still suppresses some nested filesystem read errors; a successful scan is not proof that every nested path was readable.

Headless inspection uses the same scan and search model:

```bash
native/target/debug/ts4-mod-manager-native \
  --root '/path/to/The Sims 4' --inspect --query 'filename'
```

Enable and disable first show their exact paths and warnings. Confirmation revalidates the approved review. Migration shows the external file set. Trash accepts managed mods and requires confirmation. Restore lists recoverable entries and requires a destination review. An approved operation remains associated with its original root and entry after navigation. Closing the window waits for approved operations to finish.

Find source uses real CurseForge provider results and reports a missing API key. Candidates show confidence, reasons, and evidence. Low-confidence warnings stay visible in attachment review. Manual URLs carry no verified-match claim. The native app does not download or update mods.

Startup asks the core to recover pending operations and displays recovery issues. Native toggle and migration hold the shared writer guard across revalidation and mutation. A forced process termination can interrupt approved work; core recovery preserves changed or ambiguous user paths and may require attention before further mutations. OS kill, reboot, touchpad, monitor, and screen-reader checks still need separate evidence.

Settings replaces the central library and inspector. Back to library returns to browsing; on wide windows, selecting a library filter also leaves Settings. The page scrolls below its title and always-visible Save settings action. Use `--settings` to open it directly. Light, Dark, System and saved custom-theme choices apply immediately in Settings; select Save settings to persist them. The header light/dark switch saves immediately and preserves the active custom theme and editor draft.

Custom colors remain exactly as configured in both modes. Use default colors explicitly returns to the built-in palette, retaining saved custom themes; select Save settings to persist that choice.

Create custom theme starts a named draft with the current light or dark base colors. Edit its name and six #RRGGBB fields, each with a color picker when the hex is valid: Accent, Background, Surface, Text, Muted text and Border. Reset colors restores the current light or dark base. Copy theme JSON copies a valid draft. Import a theme accepts JSON from this app or the previous version and loads it for editing. Save custom theme or the top Save settings validates, applies and persists the draft. Invalid colors, an empty name or a conflicting saved-theme name produce an error.

Settings save locally in `~/.config/ts4-mod-manager/settings.json` using atomic replacement and mode 0600 on Unix. Save settings persists the theme, local custom-theme collection and active custom-theme name, remembered game folders, selected folder, and optional API key. CLI overrides apply to that launch. Settings export requires an unused file path and omits the API key unless Include API key in export is checked. It also omits custom themes and their active name for compatibility with version-1 transfers from older releases; use the separate theme JSON copy/import controls to transfer custom colors. Settings import reads at most 1 MiB, validates and previews version 1 JSON before confirmation. It preserves the existing API key when omitted and the local custom-theme collection when the imported collection is empty or absent. Keys stay outside mod metadata and operation history.

Run tests and repeatable verification:

```bash
cargo test --manifest-path native/Cargo.toml --locked
cargo build --manifest-path native/Cargo.toml --locked
python native/verify.py
native/target/debug/ts4-mod-manager-native --verify-workflows
```

`--verify-workflows` creates its own temporary fixtures and uses the same native controller and management worker as the UI. It verifies folder and ZIP imports, reviewed enable and disable in two instances, migration, rename, manual source changes, trash and restore, missing-key errors, refreshed catalog data, and byte preservation. It prints a JSON report and ignores user paths for its fixtures.

`verify.py` creates temporary catalogs of 100, 1,000, and 10,000 mod groups, exercises the actual binary, checks Unicode/filename search and invalid paths, and verifies that input bytes and paths remain unchanged. It reports scan/search timings. For native screenshots, run this from a graphical desktop:

```bash
python native/verify.py --sizes 100 --capture-dir native/target/captures
```

This captures real light, dark, and narrow windows. To capture the current navigation and custom-theme editor on a graphical desktop:

```bash
python3 native/verify_navigation.py --capture-dir native/target/navigation-captures
```

`verify_navigation.py` defaults to the release binary; pass `--binary PATH` to use another build. It creates isolated synthetic game, managed and home directories and produces nine PNGs: four library views, three Settings views and two custom-theme editor views. It checks preview pixels in library captures and verifies that fixture inputs remain unchanged. Screenshot mode fixes the window size and quits after writing the PNG. Normal launches remain resizable. For release measurements, build with `cargo build --manifest-path native/Cargo.toml --release --locked` and pass `--binary native/target/release/ts4-mod-manager-native` to the script.

The pre-redesign migration build scanned 10,000 synthetic groups in 53 ms. On 1,000-group fixtures, three launches used median process-tree PSS of 60 MiB for native and 208 MiB for the compared Tauri release. Median window mapping was 153 ms and 173 ms. These historical fixture measurements exclude input-to-paint latency and GPU frame times; they were not repeated for the library redesign. See the [completion report](../docs/native-migration-report.md) for raw evidence, method and remaining desktop checks.

Measure native window mapping and process memory on a running Hyprland desktop without opening real game data:

```bash
python3 native/benchmark.py --native native/target/release/ts4-mod-manager-native \
  --mods 1000 --runs 3 \
  --output native/target/benchmark.json
```

Build a Linux release archive with a desktop entry, icon and dependency license inventory:

```bash
python3 native/package.py
python3 native/verify_package.py --binary native/target/release/ts4-mod-manager-native
```

Archives are written under `native/target/packages`. Pass `--binary PATH` to package an existing build or `--output PATH` to choose another destination. Packaging does not install anything. The archive's README explains local installation. The executable uses the host OpenGL driver and X11 or Wayland libraries. The verifier extracts the archive and runs its actual executable against an isolated catalog. CI builds on Ubuntu 24.04, verifies a glibc 2.39 maximum requirement, runs native tests, clippy, release fixture checks and package verification, then uploads the Linux archive. Local builds inherit the host library requirements. Fetch the complete locked dependency graph with `cargo fetch --manifest-path native/Cargo.toml --locked` before offline package metadata verification on a fresh checkout.

Unreadable scan entries and damaged mod metadata produce an incomplete-scan error; the UI retains the previous successful catalog. Recovery holdings are excluded from catalog entries. Provider lookups use a separate read-only worker, a shared 20-second network budget and 5-second request caps. DNS resolution cannot be interrupted by the HTTP library, so normal shutdown detaches that worker while continuing to wait for approved filesystem operations. Only one provider lookup can be queued through the UI at a time.

The scanner ownership fix and native controller use failing-before regression tests. Scanner tests prove managed mods stay separate when they share a folder with each other or external files, and relative managed links report installed state. Native tests cover stale success/error rejection, stable identities, same-instance refresh, Unicode/filename search, pending-request replacement, unchanged temporary inputs, CLI validation, and actual egui search interaction and virtualized rendering.

See [the investigation](../docs/fastframe-investigation.md) for the original bug inventory and [the chosen design](../docs/native-pilot-design.md) for the original controller rationale. See [native management design](../docs/native-management-design.md) for the current safety contracts. The investigation inventory describes the earlier revision.

Navigation, layout, folder and file icons are vendored from [Lucide](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide/tree/main/icons), with white strokes for Fastframe tinting. Their license is included in `licenses/Lucide-LICENSE.txt`.

Preview caching retains at most 32 image URIs and resets on Rescan or a game-folder change. Local relative paths resolve inside that instance’s Mods folder. Browser-only blob/asset URLs and data URIs are unsupported. Detail previews preserve aspect ratio with contain sizing; cards and list thumbnails use centered cover crops that account for the destination proportions. The summary scrolls independently so Files and Copy remain reachable in short windows.

The reviewed library design and tokens are recorded in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) and [the native design manifest](../.impeccable/design.json). The [surface brief](../.impeccable/surfaces/native-library.md) records the approved direction. This is a Linux egui UI; the HTML/CSS design detector does not apply.

Navigation and Settings validation passed 46 native tests, native clippy and the release build. The earlier migration also validated the React/Tauri app before its retirement. Current validation uses the core and native commands in the root README. Nine native navigation captures passed independent design review with a ship disposition. The 100, 1,000 and 10,000-group catalog checks preserved their input files; the packaged executable passed its 18-operation workflow check. These checks do not certify untested hardware or screen-reader behavior.
